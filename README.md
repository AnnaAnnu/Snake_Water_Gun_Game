#"Snake Water Gun."
This is a two-player game where each player chooses one object. 
As we know, there are three objects, snake, water, and gun. So, the result will be
Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence snake wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water, water wins
Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and gun wins.
In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.


Now moving on to instructions:

You have to use a random choice function , to select between, snake, water, and gun.
You do not have to use a print statement in case of the above function.
Then you have to give input from your side.
After getting ten consecutive inputs, the computer will show the result based on each iteration.
